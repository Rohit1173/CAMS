    <string name="what_is_cams">CAMS is a critical asset management system developed as part of a voluntary effort, led by <a href="https://www.ariseglobalnetwork.org/">ARISE-US</a>, a private-sector advisory group to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and <a href="https://www.ariseglobalnetwork.org/">TerminusDB</a>.</string>
    <string name="open_source_for_good">Open source for good</string>
    <string name="open_source_for_good_desc">The project is open source and is focused on providing a data-driven system to help islands, cities, and communities become disaster resilient. It does this by storing all critical asset data and the asset dependencies so a region understands not only what its critical assets are, but how one asset could impact other assets and the cascading effect of asset failures.</string>

    <string name="a_top_level_view_of_cams_desc">CAMS is a data-driven mobile and desktop application. It is used to plan and respond to disasters to show the impact of critical assets and the cascading failure chains in the event of a catastrophe. The application is designed to work on and offline to ensure usefulness in the event of an incident where power and connectivity are lost.\n\nThe application is designed to:\n\n\u2022 Build an inventory of all the region’s critical assets and the relevant data associated with them, for example, geographical coordinates. \n\u2022 Capture key contact information for assets – This could include multiple people for a power plant, through to a school caretaker who may have the keys to the school and need to be contacted to open it up as a place of shelter.\n\u2022 Capture data on disaster severity and impact. These can range from cybersecurity threats to natural disasters and each has differing levels of criteria in terms of impact.\n\u2022 Plot relationships, spatial and dependency, between critical assets to identify failure chains.\nProvide the ability to highlight the impact on critical assets and their failure chains based on the severity and type of disaster.\n\nUsers can then:\n\u2022\n Input and edit data via a user interface to keep assets updated.\n\u2022 Automate data input from other databases.\nImport data from flat files.\n\u2022 Identify failure chains using a browser-based desktop application and mobile app. Users will be able to use either a map GUI to identify and plot risks and their dependencies or a form-based app.\n\u2022 Provide the output of failure chains to other teams such as emergency control rooms, government officials, and risk analysis tools/teams.</string>

    <string name="technology_desc">CAMS is built on TerminusDB which is an open-source document graph database. The database itself enables you to build quickly with the simplicity of JSON documents and turn objects into powerful knowledge graphs – perfect for critical asset relationships.\n\nFor more information about the front and backend technology, visit the CAMS GitHub repo.</string>
